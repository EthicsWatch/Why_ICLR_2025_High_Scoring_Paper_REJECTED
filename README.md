Background

背景

In 2024, a massive academic scandal rocked the artificial intelligence research community.
2024年，一场巨大的学术丑闻震动了人工智能研究界。

Professor Li Chongyi of Nankai University and his collaborators at Nanyang Technological University manipulated the ICLR 2024 paper review system to give their own papers disproportionately high scores.
南开大学李重仪教授及其在南洋理工大学的合作者利用ICLR 2024的论文审稿系统，给自己的论文打了不成比例的高分。

This egregious violation of academic integrity was uncovered after a series of low-quality papers with unusually high scores drew the attention of the research community.
Due to the review mechanism of top conferences, this issue would have been difficult to detect, but the quality of their papers was so poor that even Google researchers could not overlook it. They questioned, "How could such garbage papers receive such high scores?" Ultimately, the ICLR committee officially investigated and confirmed the misconduct.

由于顶会审稿机制原因，这件事本来很难查到，但是他们的论文质量实在是太差了，连Google的人都看不下去了，说“这么垃圾的文章居然分那么高？” 最后ICLR组委会官方下场调查实锤。
这一严重违反学术诚信的行为是在几篇质量低劣但得分异常高的论文引起研究界关注后被揭露的。

This egregious violation of academic integrity was uncovered after a series of low-quality papers with unusually high scores drew the attention of the research community.

Even Google researchers expressed outrage, questioning how such poor-quality work could receive such high scores.
甚至连Google的研究人员也对此表示愤怒，质疑为何如此低劣的作品会得到如此高的分数。

The official investigation by the ICLR committee confirmed the misconduct, and actions were taken against the involved individuals.
ICLR组委会的官方调查证实了这一不当行为，并对涉事人员采取了措施。

Nanyang Technological University dismissed those involved, but Nankai University has yet to respond.
南洋理工大学已将涉事者开除，但南开大学尚未作出回应。

New Measures for ICLR 2025

ICLR 2025的新措施

To prevent a recurrence of such fraud, the ICLR 2025 organizing committee introduced stricter review processes.
为了防止此类欺诈再次发生，ICLR 2025组委会引入了更严格的审稿流程。

Now, all papers, regardless of their review scores, must be vetted by Area Chairs (AC) and Program Chairs (PC).
现在，所有论文，无论其审稿分数如何，都必须经过领域主席（AC）和程序主席（PC）的审查。

Even high-scoring papers can be rejected if the AC or PC deems them unworthy.
即使是高分论文，如果AC或PC认为其不值得，也可能会被拒绝。

This added layer of scrutiny aims to restore trust in the review process and ensure the quality of accepted papers.
这一额外的审查层旨在恢复对审稿流程的信任，并确保被接受论文的质量。


Conclusion

结论

Authors who relied solely on manipulated scores or believed their work was beyond reproach are now facing the consequences of a stricter system.

那些单纯依赖操控分数或自认为高枕无忧的作者，现在不得不面对更严格审查制度的后果。


While the new system may frustrate some researchers, it ultimately serves to uphold academic integrity and maintain the conference’s high standards.

虽然新系统可能会让一些研究人员感到沮丧，但它最终旨在维护学术诚信并保持会议的高标准。

The fallout from the ICLR 2024 scandal has reshaped the review process for 2025, making it more rigorous but still leaving room for debate.

ICLR 2024的丑闻后果重塑了2025年的审稿流程，使其更加严格，但仍然留下了争议的空间。
